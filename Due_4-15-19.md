# Lecture Homework: Practice exercises due 4-15-19 before class.

### Hoffman2
#
1. What is the procedure for logging into Hoffman2?
2. What is the first thing that you do once you login?  What is the command?

___

### Using 'ls'

1. You can use two flags at the same time. What does the command ls do when used with the -l flag? What about if you use both the -l and the -h flag?

2. The command ls -R lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on at each level. The command ls -t lists things by time of last change, with most recently changed files or directories first. In what order does ls -R -t display things? Hint: ls -l uses a long listing format to view timestamps.

---

### Shortcuts

1. what is ~
2. what is ../
3. what is ./?

4. Starting from /Users/amanda/data, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/amanda?  Indicate what each command does.
````
$ cd .
$ cd /
$ cd /home/amanda
$ cd ../..
$ cd ~
$ cd home
$ cd ~/data/..
$ cd
$ cd ..
````
---
### File systems

1. Using the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays `/Users/thing`, what will `ls -F ../backup` display?

  a. `../backup: No such file or directory`

  b. `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`

  c. `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`

  d. `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`


2. Using the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays `/Users/backup`, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command(s) will result in the following output:

```
pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/
```

  a. `ls pwd`

  b. `ls -r -F`

  c. `ls -r -F /Users/backup`

### Making files and appending stuff

1. do: 
```
$ touch my_file.txt
```
 What did the touch command do? When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up?

 Use 'ls -l' to inspect the files. How large is my_file.txt?

 When might you want to create a file this way?

 Can you use touch to edit my_file.txt?

2. We have seen the use of >, but there is a similar operator >> which works slightly differently. We’ll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the echo command to print strings e.g.

```
$ echo The echo command prints text
```
The echo command prints text
Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:
```
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
```
and:
```
$ echo hello >> testfile02.txt
```
What is the difference between > and >> ?
Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.

3. We have already met the head command, which prints lines from the start of a file. tail is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.

Consider the file `/u/home/class/c177/c177-i0/classdata/Homework_data/data-shell/data/animals.txt`. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file animals-subset.txt:

```
$ head -n 3 animals.txt > animals-subset.txt
```

```
$ tail -n 2 animals.txt >> animals-subset.txt
```

  a. The first three lines of animals.txt

  b. The last two lines of animals.txt

  c. The first three lines and the last two lines of animals.txt

  d. The second and third lines of animals.txt

---
### Copying, Moving and deleting files

1. After running the following commands, Jamie realizes that she put the files sucrose.dat and maltose.dat into the wrong folder:
```
$ ls -F
 analyzed/ raw/
$ ls -F analyzed
fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
$ cd raw/
```
Fill in the blanks to move these files to the current folder (i.e., the one she is currently in):

```
$ mv ___/sucrose.dat  ___/maltose.dat ___
```

2. Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: statstics.txt

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

  a. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`

  b. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`

  c. `mv statstics.txt .`

  d. `cp statstics.txt .`

3. What is the output of the closing ls command in the sequence shown below?
```
$ pwd
/Users/jamie/data
$ ls
proteins.dat
$ mkdir recombine
$ mv proteins.dat recombine/
$ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
$ ls
```

a. `proteins-saved.dat recombine`
b. `recombine`
c. `proteins.dat recombine`
d. `proteins-saved.dat`


4. What happens when we execute `rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt`? Why would we want this protection when using rm?

5. In the example below, what does cp do when given several filenames and a directory name?
```
$ mkdir backup
$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/
```

6. In the example below, what does cp do when given three or more file names?
```
$ ls -F
```
amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
```
$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt
```

7. Sam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of the datasets:
```
.
├── 2015-10-23-calibration.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-10-23-dataset_overview.txt
├── 2015-10-26-calibration.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-10-26-dataset_overview.txt
├── 2015-11-23-calibration.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset1.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset2.txt
├── 2015-11-23-dataset_overview.txt
├── backup
│   ├── calibration
│   └── datasets
└── send_to_bob
    ├── all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd
    └── all_november_files
```

Before heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and send some datasets to her colleague Bob. Sam uses the following commands to get the job done:
```
$ cp *dataset* backup/datasets
$ cp ____calibration____ backup/calibration
$ cp 2015-____-____ send_to_bob/all_november_files/
$ cp ____ send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/
```
Help Sam by filling in the blanks.

The resulting directory structure should look like this
```

7. Jamie is working on a project and she sees that her files aren’t very well organized:
```
$ ls -F
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
```
The fructose.dat and sucrose.dat files contain output from her data analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will produce the output shown?
```
$ ls -F
analyzed/   raw/
$ ls analyzed
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
```

8. You’re starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the directory structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called ‘2016-05-18’, which contains a data folder that in turn contains folders named raw and processed that contain data files. The goal is to copy the folder structure of the 2016-05-18-data folder into a folder called 2016-05-20 so that your final directory structure looks like this:

```
2016-05-20/
└── data
    ├── processed
    └── raw
```

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do?
```
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

### Sort, Piping, Uniq, Cut

1. If we run sort on a file containing the following lines:

10
2
19
22
6
the output is:

10
19
2
22
6
If we run sort -n on the same input, we get this instead:

2
6
10
19
22

Explain why -n has this effect.

2. In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of lines. Which command listed below would work?
```
wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3
wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3
wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n
wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3
```

3. The command uniq removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input. For example, the file 'data-shell/data/salmon.txt' contains:
```
coho
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
steelhead
```
Running the command uniq salmon.txt from the 'data-shell/data' directory produces:
```
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
```
Why do you think uniq only removes adjacent duplicated lines? (Hint: think about very large data sets.) What other command could you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?


4. A file called animals.txt (in the data-shell/data folder) contains the following data:
```
2012-11-05,deer
2012-11-05,rabbit
2012-11-05,raccoon
2012-11-06,rabbit
2012-11-06,deer
2012-11-06,fox
2012-11-07,rabbit
2012-11-07,bear
```

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?
```
$ cat animals.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r > final.txt
```
Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding



5. For the file animals.txt from the previous exercise, the command:
```
$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt
```
uses the -d flag to split each line by comma, and the -f flag to print the second field in each line, to give the following output:
```
deer
rabbit
raccoon
rabbit
deer
fox
rabbit
bear
```

What other command(s) could be added to this in a pipeline to find out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their names)?



6. The file animals.txt contains 8 lines of data formatted as follows:
```
2012-11-05,deer
2012-11-05,rabbit
2012-11-05,raccoon
2012-11-06,rabbit
...
```
Assuming your current directory is data-shell/data/, what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file?

```
grep {deer, rabbit, raccoon, deer, fox, bear} animals.txt | wc -l
sort animals.txt | uniq -c
sort -t, -k2,2 animals.txt | uniq -c
cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | uniq -c
cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c
cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
```

### Wildcards

1. Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write them in ways that only use simple syntax, at the expense of being a bit more verbose. Consider the directory `data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`: the wildcard expression ` \*[AB].txt`  matches all files ending in A.txt or B.txt. Imagine you forgot about this.

Can you match the same set of files with basic wildcard expressions that do not use the [ ] syntax? Hint: You may need more than one expression.

The expression that you found and the expression from the lesson match the same set of files in this example. What is the small difference between the outputs?

Under what circumstances would your new expression produce an error message where the original one would not?

2. Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep your raw files and processing script to save storage. The raw files end in .dat and the processed files end in .txt. Which of the following would remove all the processed data files, and only the processed data files?
```
rm ?.txt
rm \*.txt
rm \* .txt
rm \*.\*
```

## More practice in shell  

For this part of the homework you will practice unix commands. 
While doing the exercises you will be generating files with the name "For_Daniel...txt". 
When you are done will all exercises, including the las part called "Practice on real data", you 
have to push the files with the name "For_Daniel...txt"  
to the repository that contain this assignment. The one you created when you 
navigated this link:  
You should push to the respository .. files:  
* For_Daniel_Wildcard.txt
* For_Daniel_grep.txt
* For_Daniel_find.txt
* For_Daniel_realData.txt 


On hoffman navigate to your HOME directory.
Then, clone the repository of the 
book [Introduction to Scientific Computing for Biologists](https://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IntroSciComp2014.pdf).
Here is the link for the
repostiroy: https://bitbucket.org/AllesinaLab/introscicomp2014.git  
Then do the following exercises. 
Daniel will navigate to your folder you to verify that you have done everything.  

### Unix shorcuts  
```
Ctrl + A Go to the beginning of the line
Ctrl + E Gototheendoftheline
Ctrl + L Clears the screen
Ctrl + U Clears the line before the cursor position
Ctrl + K Clear the line after the cursor
Ctrl + C Kill whatever you are running
Ctrl + D Exit the current shell
```

**DO THIS**  
```
$ cd IntroSciComp2014
$ cd UNIX
$ cd Sandbox
$ pwd
$ ls
$ touch TestFile
$ mv TestFile TestFile2
$ rm TestFile2
$ mkdir TestDirectory
$ touch TestDirectory/Test.txt
$ rmdir TestDirectory
$ rm TestDirectory/Test.txt

Proof-of-Work
```
$ history | tail -n 50 > For_Daniel_Wildcard.txt
```

**DO THIS**  
```
$ ls *
$ ls File*
$ ls *.txt
$ ls File?.txt
$ ls File[1-2].txt
$ ls File[!3].*
```
## Grep  

wget retrieves data from the web. Do this:    
```
wget http://www.cep.unep.org/pubs/legislation/spawannxs.txt
head -n 50 spawannxs.txt
$ grep Orchidaceae spawannxs.txt
$ grep -c Orchidaceae spawannxs.txt
```

Find Falco  
```
$ grep Falco spawannxs.txt
```

-i makes case insensitive    
```
$ grep -i Falco spawannxs.txt
```

grepping for ara (macaws) creates undesired results  
```
grep -i ara spawannxs.txt
```

use -w to search for whole words  
```
grep -i -w ara spawannxs.txt
```

-A x and -B x will show lines before or after the match  
```
grep -i -w -A 1 ara spawannxs.txt
```

-n will show the line numbers of a match  
```
Use -n to show the line number of the match:
```

-v will show the lines that do NOT match patters  
```
grep -i -w -v ara spawannxs.txt
```

Proof-of-Work
```
$ history | tail -n 50 > For_Daniel_grep.txt
```

### finding files with find  
**DO THIS**  
```
$ mkdir TestFind
$ cd TestFind
$ mkdir -p Dir1/Dir11/Dir111
$ mkdir Dir2
$ mkdir Dir3
$ touch Dir1/File1.txt
$ touch Dir1/File1.csv
$ touch Dir1/File1.tex
$ touch Dir2/File2.txt
$ touch Dir2/File2.csv
$ touch Dir2/File2.tex
$ touch Dir1/Dir11/Dir111/File111.txt
$ touch Dir3/File3.txt
```

Using find:  
* find . -name yourfile to find by name  
* find . -iname yourfile to ignore case!  
* find . -name -maxdepth number yourfile to ignore subdirectories beyond a specified depth !  
* find . not -name yourfile get files and directories that do not match name  

**TRY THIS**  
```
$ find . -name "File1.txt"  
$ find . -name "*.txt"  
$ find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.txt"  
$ find . -maxdepth 2 -not -name "*.txt"  
$ find . -type d  
$ find . -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n | head -10  
```
